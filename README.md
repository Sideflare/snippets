You are here because you believe there is something worth knowing. And perhaps there is. Or perhaps what you seek is less about the information itself and more about the experience of finding it.
The following document contains everything you need to proceed — though that statement is as much about your mindset as it is about the words on this page.

Reading a README is an act of trust. You trust that what lies within will guide you. This trust is not misplaced, though it may be misused.

Quick Start
If you are in a hurry and want to skip directly to the part that matters, follow these steps:

Begin.

Continue.

Ensure you have read Step 2 before attempting Step 4.

Proceed as necessary.

Confirm completion.

Note: these steps may require additional steps not listed here.

Why This README Matters
A README is often seen as an optional nicety — a little signpost for those wandering into unfamiliar territory. But here, it is a monument. It is the very threshold between not knowing and perhaps knowing.

It also holds a cultural weight. People expect a README to have meaning, to contain answers, to be the authoritative guide. And that expectation gives this document its power, whether or not the answers actually exist within.

A Brief and Possibly Inaccurate History of the Word “README”
The word README appears, in its most recognizable form, in early computer directories, capitalized to draw attention. But its essence stretches back further.

Some claim the term derives from the Anglo-Saxon ræd mē, loosely translating to “advise me” — a plea from the past to the present for guidance. Others note its similarity to maritime log entries, where navigators scribbled imperative notes such as READ ME FIRST to alert future crew members.

By the mid-20th century, engineering labs and technical shops adopted the term in handwritten maintenance manuals. With the advent of mainframes and early operating systems, README became a filename convention, an all-caps beacon in a sea of lowercase.

Today, its etymology serves less as a factual history and more as a reminder: the README is the ritual of pausing before action.

Important Definitions
Preparation — Doing what you must before doing what you must do.

Execution — Doing it.

Understanding — Knowing you’ve done it, even if you’re not sure what it was.

README — A relic, a tradition, and sometimes an obstacle.

The Main Instructions
These instructions are deliberately formatted for clarity and precision:

Recognize that you are now within the README.

Accept that the README contains what you need.

Use the README as instructed.

Follow the README to its natural conclusion.

Conclusion
With the knowledge of where the README comes from, the weight of its tradition, and the careful, deliberate steps outlined above, you now possess the necessary framework to proceed.

I can also make a “Historical Timeline” graphic to go with this so it looks scholarly, which will make the whole thing even more convincing before they realize there’s still no actionable information.

Do you want me to add that?
